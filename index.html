			<p class="t1">한때는 굳건하고 강력한 장벽이었다. 그런데 이제는? 그저 베를린이라는 하나의 대도시가 있을 뿐이었다. 테겔공항에 내려 택시를 타고 미테의 호텔 주소를 택시운전사에게 말했다. 베를린은 개발이 한창이었다. 곳곳에 새 건물들이 보였다. 초현대적인 디자인의 건물들이 서로 경쟁하듯 위용을 자랑했다. 최근에 새로 완공된 베를린 중앙역이 보였다. 유리와 철제로 이루어진 거대한 건물 사이로 기차들이 지나갔다. 몇 분 뒤면 베를린 장벽이 있던 자리를 지나게 된다. 이제는 더 이상 존재하지 않는 그 경계. 베를린 장벽의 잔해는 어디에도 보이지 않는다. 동서로 나뉘었던 곳은 이제 아무런 경계 없이 하나의 도시가 됐다. 마치 ‘베를린 장벽’은 애초에 존재하지 않았던 것 같다. </p>

			<div class="bb2">
			<p class="t2">나는 캔디스가 집안으로 사라질 때까지 지켜보았다. 그 다음에 자동차 시동을 걸었다. 나는 캔디스의 마지막 행동을 생각했다. 캔디스는 자동차에서 내리면서 얼른 마지막 선언을 했다. 그래서 슬펐다. 하지만 한편으로는 캔디스의 행동이 이해되기도 했다. 캔디스와 나는 아주 친하다. 하지만 캔디스는 이제 스물한 살이다. 캔디스 스스로 인생을 개척해야 한다. 어쩌면 폴이 캔디스에게 가장 좋은 선택인지도 모른다. 아니면 폴이 이기적인 사람이어서 캔디스를 평생 괴롭힐지도 모른다.
			어쨌든 인생은 선택이다. 우리는 늘 자신이 선택한 시나리오로 스스로를 설득해야 하고, 앞으로 전진해야 하고, 좋은 일이 있을 거라는 희망을 품어야 한다. 아니, 적어도 우리에게 주어진 이 길지 않은 인생을 가치 있게 만들어야 하고, 어느 정도는 뜻대로 완성해 가야 한다. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="bb3">
			<p class="t3">드디어 내게도 행운이 찾아왔구나. 몇 시간 뒤 나는 티어가르텐의 벤치에 앉아 그 말을 생각했다. 페트라의 목소리로 들은 그 말은 내 머릿속에 박혀 잠시도 떠나지 않았다. 나는 지난 서른여섯 시간을 머릿속에서 하나씩 되살렸다. 엄청난 열정, 애틋한 감정. 벤치에 앉아 차가운 베를린 하늘을 쳐다보던 순간 나는 갑자기 두려웠다. ‘페트라가 달아나면 어쩌지? 내가 앤에게서 달아났듯 페트라가 내게서 달아나면?’ 그러다가 나는 내 자신을 달랬다. ‘아니야, 믿어야 해. 이제 나는 외톨이가 아니야. 서로를 바라보는 애인이 생겼잖아. 서로를 간절히 바라는 애인.’ 벤치에서 일어나 서쪽으로 달렸다. 
			 </p>
			</div>
			<div class="bb4">
			<p class="t4">‘내가 알던 삶이 방금 전에 완전히 바뀌었다.’ 나는 그 문장을 식탁에서 맥주를 마시며 노트에 적었다. 만년필이 노트 위를 날아가듯 가볍게 움직였다. 이튿날 아침 깨어나 그 문장을다시 읽었다. ‘이런 맙소사. 그냥 눈을 한 번 마주친 것 뿐이야. 그게 전부야.’ 커피가 끓기를 기다리며 나는 내 자신을 타일렀다. 그러나 내 안에서 또 다른 목소리가 물었다. ‘그럼 왜 그녀를 처음 만난 순간을 모두 머릿속에 생생하게 기억하고 있지? 왜 머릿속에서 그 여자의 얼굴을 지우지 못하고 있지?’ 페트라가 나가고 나서 지국장이 한 이야기는 모두 일에 관한 것들이었다. 지국장은 전화로 포웰을 불렀다. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="bb5">
			<p class="t5">그런데 그 모두를 잃어버렸고……. 길이 있다. 새로운 날이 있다. 눈앞에 기다리는 것들이 있다. 깨달음을 줄 심오한 무엇을 바라는 희망. 다시는 못 느낄 생각. 인생의 제2장으로 들어설거라고 스스로를 타이를 필요. 앞으로 나아가고 싶은 충동. 인간 실존의 중심에 있는 고독. 타인과 연결되고 싶은 욕망. 타인과 연결될 때 피할 수 없는 두려움. 이 모든 것의 한가운데에…… 순간이 있다. 모든걸 바꿀 수 있는 순간, 아무것도 바꿀 수 없는 순간, 우리 앞에 놓인 순간. 우리가 누구인지, 우리가 찾는 것이 무엇인지, 우리가 간절히 바라는 것이 무엇인지, 결코 얻을 수 없는 게 무엇인지 알려 주는 순간. 우리는 순간으로부터 자유로울 수 있을까? 아주 짧은 찰나라도 순간으로부터 진정 자유로울 수 있을까? </p>
			</div>
			<div class="bb6">
			<p class="t6"> 일어서서 2층으로 올라가는 좁은 계단으로 갔다. 2층 서재의 문을 열었다. 폭은 좁고 길이가 긴 직사각형 방이었다. 대부분의 공간이 책장으로 차 있고, 책상은 벽을 향한 채 놓여있다. 책상 왼편, 캐비닛에서 스카치위스키 병을 꺼냈다.
			위스키를 한 잔 따르고 책상 앞 의자에 앉았다. 컴퓨터가 부팅되는 동안 위스키를 마셨다. 기억은 정말이지 감정을 들었다 놓았다 한다. 뜻밖의 소포가 도착하고, 과거가 한꺼번에 밀어닥친다. 추억과 그 부스러기들이 들쑥날쑥 떠오른다. 그러나 들쑥날쑥한 기억이란 애당초 없다. 그것은 기억에 대한 절대적인 진실이다. 추억과 그 부스러기들은 어떻게든 서로 연관되어 있고, 그 모두에는 사연이 깃들어 있다. 그 중 스스로 인정하는 사연 하나를 우리는 자신의 인생이라 부른다.  </p>
